## Introduction

Real-time communication allows data to be transmitted between a client and a server without frequent polling or traditional HTTP requests. It is commonly used in:

- Chat applications
- Real-time notifications
- Live streaming
- Online multiplayer games
- Collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs)

This repository is a hands-on guide to learning real-time communication using **WebSocket** and **Socket.IO**, a powerful library that simplifies WebSocket development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.
2. Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended).
3. A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Key Concepts

### What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection. 

Key features:
- Low latency
- Real-time updates
- Persistent connection

### What is Socket.IO?

Socket.IO is a library that abstracts WebSocket and provides additional features such as:
- Automatic reconnections
- Broadcasting events
- Room-based communication
- Support for fallback technologies when WebSocket is unavailable
